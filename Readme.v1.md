# Beyond Ephemeral Applications: A Standards-Based Approach to AI-Generated Data Visualizations

The GenAI-powered data analysis has reached impressive capabilities, but **translating insights into visual formats within GenAI applications** remains a significant technical challenge. Current industry approaches using "ephemeral applications" - where AI generates and executes code in sandboxed environments - create unstable user experiences with frequent execution failures and substantial implementation complexity for custom GenAI applications.

This article examines three approaches to AI-generated data visualization:

1. The current ephemeral application model.
1. A frontend component integration
1. A standards-based solution using Vega JSON specifications 

While ephemeral applications offer flexibility, they sacrifice reliability and user experience. Frontend component approaches improve stability but create tight coupling between systems and technical debt.

The article converges on leveraging Vega JSON, a mature open-source visualization specification that AI models, due to extensive training data availability, as well as traditional software, due to the original specification design, can generate reliably. This standards-based approach **decouples frontend and backend systems** while maintaining stability, enables seamless chat history preservation, and provides cross-platform portability without requiring complex execution environments.

The key benefits of such an approach includes: 

- Dramatically improved reliability for non-technical users
- Reduced architecture and infrastructure complexity
- Better maintainability through coupling to open standards
- The ability to create sophisticated visualizations without custom development. 
- Flexibility to leverage the same data across channels (web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, and data visualization apps)

Organizations implementing AI-driven analytics should consider this approach to achieve production-grade stability while maintaining the flexibility that makes AI-generated visualizations valuable for business intelligence applications.

## The GenAI Data Visualization Challenge

The GenAI models and agentic systems are fundamentally transforming how organizations can extract insights from data. The Large Language Models (LLMs) can use various kinds of tools to query databases, perform complex analysis, and articulate findings with remarkable sophistication. Yet **a critical gap persists** at the intersection of AI capability and user experience i.e. **effectively presenting data-driven insights through visual representations within these largely text based interfaces**.

### Dynamic Visualization Requirements vs. Static Development Paradigms

The technical complexity emerges when attempting to bridge AI-generated insights with frontend application requirements. Unlike traditional business intelligence tools where visualizations follow predictable patterns that can be coded with confidence, GenAI-driven applications must dynamically generate visual charts in real-time based on conversational context, varying data structures from multiple sources, and evolving user queries. This fundamental mismatch between static development paradigms and dynamic AI requirements creates architectural friction that existing approaches struggle to resolve efficiently.

Current implementations by major providers and the broader GenAI community attempt to address these expectations through increasingly sophisticated approaches, yet they frequently suffer from instability and execution failures. These poor visualization experiences directly erode user trust in AI systems, particularly among non-technical stakeholders who interpret chart generation failures as fundamental AI limitations rather than implementation challenges.


## The Core Problem: AI Can't Simply Execute What It Creates

The fundamental friction in AI-generated data visualization stems from a core architectural mismatch. **User Interface (UI) technologies**, including data visualization tools, are predominantly built around an **imperative programming paradigm**, meaning that generating UI dynamically requires executable code on the UI platform. Whether it's JavaScript for web applications, SwiftUI for iOS, or platform-specific graphics libraries elsewhere, the process demands that code be written, then executed in the correct environment to transform data into rendered graphics.

While GenAI systems excel at generating the necessary code, that code cannot be executed directly within application UI due to:

1. Technical compatibility constraints that arise because UI platforms operate within specific programming language ecosystems and runtime environments. For example, a web browser expecting JavaScript cannot directly execute Python Matplotlib code.

1. More fundamentally, security restrictions do not allow such kind of operations. Cross-site scripting (XSS) protections, which are essential OWASP security standards, explicitly prevent the execution of dynamically generated code within client applications.

The result is an execution gap where AI systems can generate sophisticated visualization code but cannot bridge the final step of rendering that code within the user's interface, forcing current solutions to rely on complex workarounds that compromise either security, reliability, or user experience.

## Production-grade GenAI data visualization requirements

This technical landscape demands a systematic evaluation of available approaches, their trade-offs, and emerging solutions that enable enterprise applications to deliver:

- The flexibility GenAI enables
- Production-grade stability
- Long-term maintainability and evolvability

### Approach 1: Ephemeral Applications - The Current Industry Standard

Major GenAI providers, like OpenAI and Anthropic, have established the current industry standard through what has become known as the "ephemeral application" approach. This model treats data visualization as a general code execution problem, where AI systems generate programming code on-demand and execute it within sandboxed environments to produce visual outputs.

#### Technical Overview

The providers navigate the AI code execution problem by leveraging cloud-based execution environments like CodeSandbox and Replit that execute the dynamically generated code and return rendered visualizations.

This is a logical evolution from pre-GenAI solutions where developers needed remote code execution environment to facilitate collaboration. The same infrastructure that enabled collaborative coding environments now powers AI-generated visualizations, creating a familiar technical foundation for major providers to build upon.

#### Strategic Advantages for General-Purpose Platforms

The ephemeral application approach delivers significant strategic advantages for platforms serving diverse user bases such as ChatGPT and Claude. The generality of code execution enables users to request virtually any type of visualization or even complete applications, limited only by the AI's programming capabilities and available libraries. This flexibility aligns perfectly with the positioning of general-purpose AI assistants that must handle unpredictable user requests across unlimited domains.

This approach minimizes the need for specialized tooling or predefined visualization types. A single execution environment can theoretically handle everything from simple bar charts to complex interactive dashboards, machine learning visualizations, or even basic web applications. This architectural decision reduces platform complexity while maximizing perceived AI capabilities.

#### Enterprise Implementation Challenges

Despite its strategic benefits for general-purpose platforms, the ephemeral application model introduces substantial challenges for enterprise implementations. The most significant technological **issues are complexity, reliability, and maintainability**.

Even when leveraging existing code execution SaaS products, development teams must architect, secure, deploy, and maintain sophisticated execution environments. This infrastructure requires container orchestration, security sandboxing, resource management, and cleanup processes, each introducing potential failure points and ongoing operational overhead that scales with user adoption.

> This is significant investment especially if the aim of the feature is to only generate data visualizations

#### The Unpredictability Problem

The open-ended nature of code generation creates inherent unpredictability that compounds these challenges. AI models frequently generate vastly different code implementations for identical requests, making it nearly impossible to optimize execution environments for consistent performance. Additionally, models must navigate execution environment constraints, available library versions, and coding standards that may not be explicitly documented in their training data, leading to **frequent execution failures that directly impact user experience**.
